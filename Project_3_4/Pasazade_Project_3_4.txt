Summary Document: 
	1. Meeting the specifications: Website has 4 pages:
		- Home Page: Only HTML and CSS is used.
		- Navigation Bar: navigation bar is a common area of every other page. We can change nav bar from one file and it changes in every page that used it.
		- Store Page: 
		  * 3 jQuery-UI widgets. 
			1. Tooltip widget. shows a little message of price for dollars.
			2. Shopping cart drop down menu. It can be opened and closed by clicking on the cart icon.
			   When user clicks "BUY" button on game cards. Games are automatically dropped to the shopping cart.
			3. Purchase modal widget. Requires Card name, number, expiration date and cvv. Alerts errors if one or more of the inputs are invalid.
		  * 1 jQuery plugin: Preview hover screen on cards of the games.
		  * 1 Externel AJAX request that fetches the current currency of Turkish Lira - U.S Dollars to show up-to-date currency of prices of the games.
		- Community Page: Includes a local JSON request to get post objects. A post card is divided by 3 parts. 
				  Top part includes name and profile picture of user and game name which is talked about.
				  Middle part includes the maing text.
				  Bottom part includes like and dislike buttons. User can increade the number of likes and disliked by clicking on it.
	2. Intelligent Orb is meets the need of getting latest information and news of every kind of game. 
	   Website also gives the opportunity to purchase the most and newest games in store.
	   The biggest flaw of this website is membership, and I would like to implement this in future.
