                        <h3>Elden Ring Fan Puts Together Complete Timeline Of All Its Wars</h3>
                        <p>Thanks to George R. R. Martin, Elden Ring has a comprehensive history that we see snippets of in-game as we traverse the ruins of several bygone eras. 
                           This means there's a lot to unpack before we even set foot in The Lands Between, but given that most of it is inferred through dialogue and item descriptions that are easily missed, it can be hard to pinpoint when exactly certain events took place. 
                           So, one fan has put together a complete timeline.</p>

                        <h3>The Last Of Us Part 1's PC Port Is Facing Complaints Over Constant Crashes</h3>
                        <p>When it comes to PlayStation's PC offerings, they've been fairly reliable in terms of quality and performance. 
                           You'll rarely hear about a PlayStation port running poorly on the day of launch, yet that's exactly what seems to be happening with the recently released port of The Last of Us Part 1.
                           First reported by Steam Deck Gaming on Twitter, it appears that players are having to wait for up to 2 hours for the game to build shaders after booting it up for the first time. 
                           It's reported that this is causing the main menu to run extremely slowly, yet that doesn't appear to be the worst of the issues.</p>

                        <p>One of the aspects of the Diablo 4 beta I enjoyed the most was exploring the initial snowy, mountainous zone. 
                           It's one area of the game that feels like a pretty significant upgrade from past games, full of interesting things to discover, be it side quests, world bosses or dungeons.
                           Well, if you like that, the rest of the map looks like it is a whole lot more of that. 
                           The above image is the entirety of the current Diablo 4 map. 
                           I'm not sure where this originally came from but I found it via Jez Corden.</p>

                        <h3>Resident Evil 4 Sells Tremendously Well in Its First Two Days</h3>
                        <p>Capcom's recent remake of Resident Evil 4 has been experiencing tremendous success since it launched, and it's been revealed that the game sold more than three million units in just a couple of days. 
                           Horror games seem to be selling well at the moment, proving that the genre is as strong as ever. 
                           Scary video games may not be to everyone's taste, but with a lot to look forward to from both the AAA and indie scenes, there's plenty of choice on offer for fans.
                           Since releasing on March 24, Resident Evil 4 has been met with high praise, with the game being particularly noteworthy for its ability to retain what made the original so special while giving it a much-appreciated contemporary makeover. 
                           There are some who even feel it may have surpassed its predecessor in terms of quality. 
                           Even before the game launched, people had high hopes for it, thanks in part to the demo that gave players a tiny slice of things to come.</p>
